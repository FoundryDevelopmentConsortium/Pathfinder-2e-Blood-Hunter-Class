- Need to figure out if the stuff that "upgrades" can be listed once, and
  then the "rule-element" definitions can upgrade a single entry in place.
  so instead of blood-pool needing multiple entries, it's a single entry that
  gets applied a specified levels with additional rules with each expansion.

- This is also missing, and would need I believe the increases to perception,
  fortitude, reflex, and will saves. You also need unique names for these things.
  You see this with other classes, where the "classfeature" isn't just fortitude to mastery
  but there is a name that is unique to the class, this also allows for a unique entry here.
